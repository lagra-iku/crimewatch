# CrimeWatch App
### A demo project to fulfill ALX Software Engineering Project 

## Introduction
CrimeWatch is a criminal records management system application designed to address the inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities of current criminal records management methods used by the police in Nigeria. Many police stations in Nigeria still rely heavily on paper-based records to document and maintain criminal records which are then stored in physical files and archives that could get damaged.
